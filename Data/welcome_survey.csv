In high school, I took AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A which covered Python and Java respectively so I'm hoping those memories will come back.

I get sick a lot (bad immune system) so a lenient absence policy is always good for me because I think coming to class sick is rude and I often end up stuck in bed when I'm sick. I also appreciate recorded lectures being uploaded on MediaSpace so I can catch up without having to ask around for bits and pieces. 

 

 ","To reiterate, I get sick a lot. I promise I'm not missing class if I don't have to and I absolutely hate being behind. But, I will put my health first and not come to class if sick for the respect of my peers and my physical health. Please don't penalize me for it.
